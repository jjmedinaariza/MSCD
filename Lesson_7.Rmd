#Crime and incident trend identification


All crimes occur at a specific date and time, however such definite temporal information is only available when victims or witnesses are present, alarms are triggered, etc., at the time of occurrence. This specific temporal data is most often collected in crimes against persons. In these cases, cross-tabulations or histogram6 of weekday and hour by count will suffice. The great majority of reported events are crimes against property. In these cases, there are seldom victims or witnesses present. These events present the analyst with ‘ranged’ temporal data, that is, an event reported as occurring over a range of hours or even days. In the case of ranged temporal data, analysis is possible through use of equal chance or probability methods. If an event was reported as having occurred from Monday to Tuesday, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed the event had an equal chance or probability of occurring on each of the two days, or .5 (%50). In the same manner, if an event was reported as having occurred over a 10 hour span there is a 10% chance the event occurred during any one of the hours. This technique requires a reasonable number of events in the data set to be effective. The resulting probabilities are totaled in each category and graphed or cross-tabulated. This produces a comparison of relative frequency, by weekday or hour [source](http://cradpdf.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/PDFS/unc76/p530054.pdf).


Temporal crime analysis looks at trends in crime or incidents. A crime or incident trend is a broad direction or pattern that specific types or general crime and/or incidents are following.

Three types of trend can be identified:

- overall trend – highlights if the problem is getting worse, better or staying the same over a period of time
- seasonal, monthly, weekly or daily cycles of offences – identified by comparing previous time periods with the same period being analysed
- random fluctuations – caused by a large number of minor influences, or a one-off event, and can include displacement of crime from neighbouring areas due to partnership activity or crime initiatives.

#Time series

A Time Series is an ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced time intervals.
Time series occur frequently when looking at industrial data. The usage of time series models is threefold:

- To help reveal or clarify trends by obtaining an understanding of the underlying forces and structure that produced the observed data
- To forecast future patterns of events by fitting a model
– To test the impact of interventions 


All time-series data have three basic parts:
– A trend component;
– A seasonal component; and
– A random component.

Trends are often masked because of the combination of
these three components
– Especially the random noise!

Two types of patterns are important:
– Linear or non-linear trends - i.e., upwards or downwards or both
(quadratic); and
– Seasonal effects which follow the same overall trend but repeat
themselves in systematic intervals over time. 

Smoothing data removes random variation and shows trends and cyclic components	Inherent in the collection of data taken over time is some form of random variation. There exist methods for reducing of canceling the effect due to random variation. An often-used technique in industry is "smoothing". This technique, when properly applied, reveals more clearly the underlying trend, seasonal and cyclic components.
There are two distinct groups of smoothing methods 


In this course we will stick to the first option, and in particular we will look into producing *moving averages* and *smoothing techniques*. A sophisticated method for revealing trends is known as *seasonal decomposition*.
